# Flask Blog

This is a web app to perform CRUD operation on posts and users

## Things I learnt using this web app
* creating routes and rendering templates using flask
* using WTF forms
* using SQLAlchemy/ ORM with sqlite db
* user authentication and user management
* adding route guards to routes
* pagination using SQLAlchemy
* Sending emails for password reset
* subdivision of routes using flask blueprints
* adding error handlers to my application
* creating app factory
* passing differnt configs to the app factory (though i have used only one configruation,i.e, dev :sweat_smile:) 

### will add more features to this as I learn more and more about flask :nerd_face:
